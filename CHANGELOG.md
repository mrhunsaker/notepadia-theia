# Changelog

## 0.1.1 (unreleased)

- Added `applications/browser`: browser-first development application served at
  `http://localhost:3000`. `yarn build`/`yarn start` now default to it.
- Root scripts reworked: `build`, `start`, `watch` target the browser app;
  Electron remains available via `build:electron`, `start:electron` and
  `build:all`.
- Added `react`/`react-dom` as direct application dependencies (peer
  dependencies of `@theia/core`).
- Removed stale Yarn Berry artifacts (`.pnp.cjs`, `.pnp.loader.mjs`,
  `.yarn/unplugged`) that prevented esbuild from resolving packages.
- Linux packaging precedence set to AppImage, then RPM, then DEB; desktop entry
  file associations added.
- CI now builds the browser application on Linux and uploads its artifacts.
- Updated README, architecture notes, artifact manifest and continuation prompt.
